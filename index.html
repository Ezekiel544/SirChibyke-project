        <h1>This is my Topic on Git and Github</h1>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system that is used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, make changes to the codebase, and track those changes over time. Git also provides features for branching, merging, and reverting to previous versions of the code.

            GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers additional collaboration features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools. It allows developers to store their Git repositories in the cloud and easily collaborate with others by sharing their codebase.
            
            In summary, Git is a version control system used locally or within an organization&#39;s infrastructure, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates collaboration among developers.</p>
